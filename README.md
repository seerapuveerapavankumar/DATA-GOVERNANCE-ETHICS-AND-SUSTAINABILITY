### 1. **data_governance_framework.pdf**  
This document outlines the core principles of data governance, including policies for:
- **Data Quality**: Ensuring accuracy, consistency, and reliability of data  
- **Data Security**: Protecting data from unauthorized access, breaches, and misuse  
- **Data Privacy**: Ensuring that data collection, storage, and usage comply with privacy laws  
- **Data Accessibility**: Ensuring authorized stakeholders can access data when needed while maintaining privacy  
- **Data Stewardship**: Assigning ownership and responsibility for data management within an organization  

### 2. **ethical_data_practices.md**  
This markdown file delves into the ethical considerations of handling data. It addresses:
- The importance of **informed consent** for data collection  
- Ensuring **fairness** in data usage and avoiding bias  
- Promoting **transparency** in how data is used and shared  
- Protecting **vulnerable populations** in datasets  
- Balancing **corporate interests** with public good in data applications  

### 3. **sustainability_analysis.py**  
This Python script analyzes data related to sustainability efforts. It may include:
- Tracking **carbon footprints** of data centers and computing resources  
- Monitoring **energy consumption** in data management practices  
- Analyzing the **environmental impact** of cloud storage versus on-premise data storage  
- Identifying opportunities to **reduce waste** and optimize data processes for sustainability  

### 4. **data_compliance_report.pdf**  
This PDF document outlines the organization’s compliance with global data protection regulations, including:
- **GDPR**: General Data Protection Regulation, focusing on data privacy, subject rights, and organizational responsibility  
- **CCPA**: California Consumer Privacy Act, emphasizing consumer rights to data access and deletion  
- **Other Standards**: International regulations around data protection, security, and privacy  

### 5. **dashboard.ipynb**  
A Jupyter notebook that provides an interactive **dashboard** to:
- Monitor key sustainability metrics related to data operations  
- Track **energy consumption** and **emission reduction** in data systems  
- Visualize **compliance data** with various regulations, helping organizations ensure they are meeting legal requirements
